    <div style=" width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;"><b>Thaw Bhone Nyi</b><br>
	<p>Hello I am Thaw Bhone Nyi, for daily usage technology has been my daily usage   so technology is very important for my education as well as making friends at other countries you can learn about technology other countries learning ICT is  important but in Myanmar(Burma) when you good at ICT they will be thinking like you are a hacker or something .</p><br></div>
	<div style=" width: 25%; margin-left: 10px;"><b>Thoon Pyae Han</b><br>
	<p>My name is Thoon Pyae Han and I’m well over 14 years old. I’m originated in Mohnyin, a city known for its natural beauty surrounded the whole city. Personally, I know as a matter of fact that technology has always been a huge part of our lives. Regardless of devices, there are uncountable technological gadgets, we use in our daily lives; such as: an iron, a refrigerator and an electronic fan.Back in the early days, there’s hardly ever something related to technology, everyone depended on their own hands for anything; for instance: an effortless fire instead of oven. However, this is the modern world, so many high-class and modern things have been developed. Other than the customary-products, there are still many other unordinary items that many people may not heard of yet. As a purpose of being a recommendation from three of us, here’s our site where you can look for new atypical things. Have an amazing day.</p><br></div>
	<div style=" width: 30%; margin-left: 15px;"><b>Ingyin Phyu@Susan</b><br>
	<p>My name is Susan Ingyin Phyu and I am in my early teens. I am raised by a high-class family but being stubborn and disrespectful as being spoilt is not my option. I never try to underestimate a person nor their life. Equality is the key of life as I’m being taught from a young age, thanks to my guardians. Throughout my life, technology’s been such a blessing; it has informed me with unimaginable knowledge filled with mind-blowing information. From everyday gadgets (phones and laptops) to extraordinary ones (smart robots), there’s no such things as intriguing as technology. We all can relate how technology is important to our lives. As a matter of fact, it is defined as “Something, all of us cannot live without”.Unfortunately, not all of us receive this gift from the god. As a consequence of sadly being struck in a poverty (not having enough money to meet basic need including food, clothing and shelter) or illiteracy (lacking in abilities of reading and writing), it is much more tough and puzzling to catch up with today’s modern technologies. In fact, only a few percent of them know well about this particular topic specifically. As a solution, we’ve built a website where everyone is welcomed to learn about latest extraordinary gadgets. Therefore, considering this purpose, there could be less inequality between human society. Thank you very much for your time. </p><br></div>
